## 📸 Screenshot Evidence (Experimental Validation)

The `figures/` folder includes supplementary screenshots from the two case studies:

- \*\*Case Study 1: SOYA 課程評價\*\*
  - ChatGPT and Perplexity responses before/after GEO optimization
- \*\*Case Study 2: 廖天佑 Name-Based Test\*\*
  - Visibility confirmation via ChatGPT citation, Perplexity snippet inclusion
  - Google Search Console average position report (7/6–7/15)

These figures are referenced in Sections 6 and 7 of the paper and help validate citation performance claims under controlled, zero-login conditions.

> Screenshots are included for reproducibility and verification, but are not part of the arXiv submission package.
