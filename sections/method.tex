\section{Methodology: Technical Implementation of GEO}

To operationalize the three-layer semantic visibility model, we constructed a multi-stage GEO implementation pipeline using publicly available tools and lightweight deployment infrastructure. This section details the real-world execution process, emphasizing reproducibility, modularity, and platform neutrality.

\subsection{Content Generation and Structuring}

Initial content was drafted by dictating past experience and project descriptions using ChatGPT’s voice-to-text transcription. Supporting materials such as research notes and structured knowledge were integrated via ChatGPT’s linker and research tools.

Each content block was revised to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Maintain modular paragraphing (3--5 sentences)
  \item Use informative, scoped H2/H3 headers
  \item Provide standalone blocks such as lists, FAQs, and short definitions
\end{itemize}
This directly supports Layer 1 and Layer 3 of the semantic visibility model.

\subsection{Deployment via Semantic Mesh}

Using Claude 3’s “Project Knowledge” export function, structured content was published as static HTML files. These were organized on GitHub Pages under a mesh architecture:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Pillar nodes}: author profile, main topic overview
  \item \textbf{Cluster nodes}: grouped pages (e.g., SEO, LLM, case studies)
  \item \textbf{Mini nodes}: specific modules or tools
\end{itemize}
Each page interlinked upward toward its Pillar node, maintaining semantic cohesion and low crawl depth.

\subsection{Schema Integration}

Pages used Schema.org markup in JSON-LD format. Depending on content type, we added:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Article} and \texttt{FAQPage} for explanatory and Q\&A blocks
  \item \texttt{Person} and \texttt{WebPage} for biography and overview pages
\end{itemize}
Markup was validated via Google’s Rich Results Test.

\subsection{Indexing and Monitoring}

Pages were submitted through Google Search Console. During the 7/6--7/15 observation period, indexation coverage was confirmed. Although average rank was low (position 10.7), citation occurred in generative responses before reaching top SERP.
