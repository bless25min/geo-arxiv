\section{Control Experiment: Name-Based GEO Visibility Test}

To isolate the effects of GEO from traditional SEO ranking, we conducted a mini-experiment using the author’s name, ``\textbf{\CJKfamily{bsmi}廖天佑},'' as the target query. Prior to this experiment, no indexed content existed under this name in major generative engines.

\subsection{Design Motivation}
A known high-profile student with the same name dominates Google results and occupies top-ranking spots. The experiment asked whether GEO optimization alone---absent SEO ranking or backlinks---could enable content visibility in ChatGPT and Perplexity.

\subsection{GEO Implementation}
Between July 6 and July 15, 2025, the following pipeline was executed:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Recorded biography and project data via ChatGPT voice dictation
  \item Structured content using linker tools and exported as HTML (via Claude)
  \item Hosted on GitHub Pages with Semantic Mesh interlinking
  \item Embedded \texttt{Person}, \texttt{FAQPage}, and \texttt{Article} schemas
  \item Submitted all pages to Google Search Console (no SEO tuning applied)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Quantitative Results (7/15)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{GSC average rank:} 10.7
  \item \textbf{Google rank:} Page 3
  \item \textbf{ChatGPT:} 5 of 9 segments cited the author site
  \item \textbf{Perplexity:} 3 of 5 segments cited the author site
\end{itemize}

ChatGPT explicitly distinguished two entities: one highly publicized student, and the other ``a digital researcher involved in SEO and generative content,” referring to the author.

\subsection{Interpretation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Despite low Google rank, GEO methods achieved over 55\% citation rate
  \item Disambiguation occurred due to strong semantic anchoring (name + schema)
  \item No backlinks or SEO methods were used---only semantic restructuring
\end{itemize}

This confirms that citation in generative search is not dependent on SEO prominence but rather on how well the content is structured for generative ingestion and reuse \cite{aggarwal2024geo}.
